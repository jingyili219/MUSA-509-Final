## Project Description

This project aims to address the challenges faced by the public transit system in Charlotte, where certain routes are underperforming in terms of efficiency, passenger satisfaction, and profitability. By leveraging advanced cloud computing resources, the project seeks to analyze vast amounts of transit data to identify patterns, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.

## Technologies

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Uses BigQuery for data warehousing and Compute Engine for processing.
- **Carto**: Uses both the interface and SQl to manipulate visualizations.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Conduct comprehensive analysis to explore current transit trends and demography.
- **Predictions**: Modeling and predicting future riderships.
- **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations to improve transit system.
